          Unity In Christ is UC Berkeley’s Christian inter-fellowship group.<br><br>
            The purpose of UiC is to promote unity of Christians on campus, empower one another in prayer, service, and evangelism, and provide support for new students seeking churches and Christian fellowship. To accomplish these goals, UiC serves as a forum community where representatives of fellowships can share information, talents, and ideas to provide encouragement, offer and receive prayer, learn about and publicize each other’s events, prepare large-scale events, and work towards building greater unity and knowledge of the diversity of the body of Christ.

            As our Lord Jesus prayed, “I have given them the glory that You gave Me, that they may be one as We are one: I in them and You in Me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that You sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.” (John 17:22-23)

          We affirm our common faith in these things:<br>
          1. The unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, one God existing in three persons as an eternal fellowship of holy love.<br>
          2. The sovereignty of God in creation, revelation, redemption and final judgment.<br>
          3. The unique divine inspiration and truthfulness of Holy Scripture and its supreme authority in all that it affirms.<br>
          4. The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the fall, rendering men and women deserving of God’s just judgment.<br>
          5. The full deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, sent by the Father, manifested by the Holy Spirit; who is the incarnate Son of God, his personal pre-existence, his virgin birth, his real humanity and sinless life, his death on the cross, his bodily resurrection, and his present reign in heaven and earth.<br>
          6. The deliverance from the guilt, penalty and power of sin only through the sacrificial death once and for all time of our representative and substitute Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and humankind.<br>
          7. God’s act of undeserved mercy, in which repentant sinners are pardoned of all their sins, and accepted as righteous in God’s sight.<br>
          8. God’s mercy is only because of the righteousness of Christ imputed to humankind, and this justification is received by faith alone.<br>
          9. The deity and personhood of the indwelling Holy Spirit, who is the effective agent in regeneration, and who equips believers to live holy lives, and to serve God in faithful witness and service in the world.<br>
          10. The only holy universal Church, which is the Body of Christ, and to which all true believers belong as part of the family of God.<be>
          11. The future personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge every person with perfect justice.<br>
