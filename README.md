Unity In Christ is UC Berkeley’s Christian inter-fellowship group.

The purpose of UiC is to promote unity of Christians on campus, empower one
another in prayer, service, and evangelism, and provide support for new students
seeking churches and Christian fellowship. To accomplish these goals, UiC serves
as a forum community where representatives of fellowships can share information,
talents, and ideas to provide encouragement, offer and receive prayer, learn
about and publicize each other’s events, prepare large-scale events, and work
towards building greater unity and knowledge of the diversity of the body of
Christ.
